Privacy Policy for **Gentoo Update** mobile app

Effective date: 2023-08-25

Thank you for choosing Gentoo Update.  

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application. Please read this policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the app.  

1. COLLECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION
We do not actively collect any personal information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us.  

Anonymous Login: When you use our mobile application, we employ the anonymous login method. This means a random user ID is generated for you, but this ID does not personally identify you or store any of your personal data.  

2. USE OF YOUR INFORMATION
The sole purpose of generating a random user ID and token is to facilitate the communication between the gentoo_update CLI application and the mobile app. This allows you to receive update reports from your Gentoo Linux instance.  

3. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION
We will not share any user-generated data with third parties.  

4. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
Encryption: To enhance the security of your information, the token used for communication between the CLI and the mobile app is encrypted using AES keys before being stored in Firebase. We are also in the process of encrypting update reports to further secure your data.  

Open Source: The code for the [CLI](https://github.com/Lab-Brat/gentoo_update), [mobile app](https://github.com/Lab-Brat/gentoo_update_flutter/tree/main/lib), and [Cloud Functions](https://github.com/Lab-Brat/gentoo_update_flutter/tree/main/functions) is open-sourced on GitHub, ensuring transparency and community oversight on security practices.  

5. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES
The mobile application may contain links to third-party websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our app and to read the privacy statements of any other site that collects personal information.  

6. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.

Disclaimer: This privacy policy is intended to serve as a starting point. Depending on your region and specific regulations (like GDPR for European users), you may need additional clauses. It's always a good practice to consult with a legal professional when crafting a privacy policy for your application.
